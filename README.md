# About
With experience in software engineering, I bring a strong focus on frontend development coupled with expertise in clean architecture principles. My proficiency lies in crafting robust, scalable solutions utilizing React and Node.js frameworks.

I've led pivotal roles in complex projects, notably spearheading ecommerce implementations for industry giants like Carrefour. Leveraging the VTEX platform, I orchestrated seamless integrations and optimizations to enhance user experiences and drive business growth.

My approach revolves around meticulous attention to detail and a commitment to writing clean, maintainable code. By adhering to best practices in clean architecture, I ensure the longevity and extensibility of the systems I build.

In addition to my frontend prowess, I possess a comprehensive skill set encompassing testing methodologies such as Cypress and Jest, as well as proficiency in continuous integration and delivery pipelines.
